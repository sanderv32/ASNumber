# ASNumber
This Chrome extension shows the AS number of the site you visit.

Extension uses dig.jsondns.org or restdns.net to get the information about the site. Requests are cached for 8 hours (can be changed in the options) so that sites in the same BGP Prefix don't need to be queried every time.

You can download the extension from [here](https://github.com/sanderv32/ASNumber/raw/master/bin/ASNumberV2.4.crx).
